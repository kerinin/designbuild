+ projected costs
+ active tasks
+ inherited quantities
+ rework markups
+ auto-deactivate at 100%
+ refactor deadlines to be either relative or absolute, cache relative deadline value

-bugs
edit markup makes tons of duplicates, deleting one removes them all (from project & component)
new components not inheriting markups on create, but inheriting on edit (from #index and #show)
changing task to active fucks up redirect (from #index)
editing deadline removes it from task, but does update the dl (task#index, task#show)


- usability tweaks
++ autocomplete supplier selection (and creation)
++ pop-up for new employee, new PO, new labor cost
++ easy way to pair components & tasks
++ show which components not associated, quickly make new tasks
++ checkbox to show unit costs on estimate
-- after adding employee, active the labor entry field and pre-select the new person
-- how to destroy markups?  (auto delete if no associated?)
-- ajax for PO#log_cost material#edit_cost
-- click tr edits/shows
-- spinners
-- icons
-- explanative text
-- help buttons
-- table alignment
