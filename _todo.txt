To look into
- graph of RB doesn't seem to be updating
- fixed / cost+ interface - consider use cases
+ labor comments not showing
+ simple cost addition (insurance bill, etc)
+ labor cost date editing



* notice box behavior erratic
* task#scheduling needs redesign (also not working too well)
* new cost tab CSS


- ul-based component hierarchy.  sortable between components, collapsible (component list doesn't d&d)
- named data points (which don't get over-written)
- add return true unless changed? to callbacks
- add markup (esp. to project) very slow.  delayed job?

- bank draws (invoice tracking)
-- JS total for balanced
-- validate uniqueness of invoice date in context of project
-- round to cent (decimal migration)
-- payment line functional tests

- use awesome_nested_set instead of ancestry
- unit tests for task.component_*_cost
- better coverage on markup tests
+ task ordering / sorting
- milestone / task percent complete UI


- usability tweaks
++ sparklines @ task, component index
-- after adding employee, active the labor entry field and pre-select the new person
-- how to destroy markups?  (auto delete if no associated?)
-- ajax for PO#log_cost material#edit_cost
-- integrate different cost types into single display
-- modal cost creation dialog; unit/fixed/contract/etc
-- project markups interface broken
-- change cost's component
-- component tabs: costs/markups/quantities


- performance
++ Model.association.sum(attribute)
-- alternate caching strategies (delete on change, generate on demand?, eliminate completely?, view caching?)
-- eliminate redundant caching


- reporting
-- estimates, proposals, invoices
++ work timeline w/ deadlines
++ labor reporting for michelle
++ graphs

- project as contract
- user permissions
- equation quantities
- parametric components


Completed
+ projected costs
+ active tasks
+ inherited quantities
+ rework markups
+ auto-deactivate at 100%
+ refactor deadlines to be either relative or absolute, cache relative deadline value
+ versioning (https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail)
+ xhr functional tests
+ add actual finish date to deadlines
+ task has_many milestones
+ re-work markups to be at bottom
+ drag & drop positioning of components, tasks, contracts
+ add note field to labor cost
+ material cost summary
+ allow editing of labor cost date (material cost?)
+ projected net (estimated_cost - raw_projected_cost)
+ contracts in components

+ project dashboard
++ active tasks (with labor + material creation buttons)
++ printable timeline
++ projected cost
++ print purchase orders
++ schedule

+ bank draws (invoice tracking)
++ clean up tests
++ filtering costs by effective date
++ states for tasks w/o estimate
++ estimates should be estimated_cost, cost
++ tasks not reflected in components
++ invoicing when previous payments not distributed to components
++ refactor controller to be step-based
++ states for payments that don't balance
++ controller tests
++ track costs back to estimate
++ contract cost error on new invoice
++ only show 'next step' on payments if balanced
++ drawing retainage
++ unexpected retainage UI

+ usability tweaks
++ autocomplete supplier selection (and creation)
++ pop-up for new employee, new PO, new labor cost
++ easy way to pair components & tasks
++ show which components not associated, quickly make new tasks
++ checkbox to show unit costs on estimate
++ click tr edits/shows
++ spinners
++ icons
++ explanative text
++ table alignment

+ deleting markup doesn't refresh cost
+ edit laborer

- New UI problems
- in-table creation shouldn't autoclick new button
- laborer#new not updated
- laborer#show not updated
- remove link to user#new on user#index
- user#edit not updated
- user#destroy broken (redirect - seems to destroy OK)
- show project list in nav even if @project.nil?
- project#markups destroy redirects incorrectly
- component#index rename ajax fails (but updates)
- component#new_cost fixed cost redirects incorrectly
- contract#show should have breadcrumbs
- component#quantities should use add button (not inline in table)
- component#quantities redirects incorrectly
- component#markups destroy redirects incorrectly
- component#markups remove redirects incorrectly
- task#index should show add button
- material_cost#show UI not update
- material_cost#show link should direct to task#costs
- material_cost#show log hours note field too large
- after cost added to task, should redirect to task#costs
- task#markups showing destroy but not remove
- task#costs 'add material cost' should show amount in form
- task#scheduling redirect wrong on deadline removal, addition
- deadline#index should use add button
- can't add component to new project
- add button to create component @ component#index
- add button to create component @ component#index
    component#index uses different templates for index and subcomponent index
    this requires different input forms, if we're doing it inline (rather than popup)
    also, the buttons don't work
    This also causes problems with subcomponent creation
- component#quantities inserts edit field into both tables on 'edit'
- task#index rows messed up on edit
    This is due to the modal fixed bid / cost+ interface
- task#index submitting task drop down also submits new tr
    nested forms.  Need to find a way to avoid this...
- component#new_cost unit cost UI still needs work, doesn't add correctly
