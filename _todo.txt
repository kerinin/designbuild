+ projected costs
+ active tasks
+ inherited quantities
+ rework markups
+ auto-deactivate at 100%
+ refactor deadlines to be either relative or absolute, cache relative deadline value
+ versioning (https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail)
+ xhr functional tests
+ add actual finish date to deadlines
+ task has_many milestones
+ re-work markups to be at bottom
+ drag & drop positioning of components, tasks, contracts
+ add note field to labor cost
+ material cost summary
+ allow editing of labor cost date (material cost?)
+ projected net (estimated_cost - raw_projected_cost)
+ contracts in components
+ project dashboard
++ active tasks (with labor + material creation buttons)
++ printable timeline
++ projected cost
++ print purchase orders
++ schedule

- bank draws (invoice tracking)
++ clean up tests
++ filtering costs by effective date
++ states for tasks w/o estimate
-- drawing retainage
++ estimates should be estimated_cost, cost
++ tasks not reflected in components
-- invoicing when previous payments not distributed to components
-- unexpected retainage UI
-- round to cent (decimal migration)
++ refactor controller to be step-based
++ states for payments that don't balance
++ controller tests
-- validate uniqueness of invoice date in context of project
++ track costs back to estimate
-- contract cost error on new invoice

- use awesome_nested_set instead of ancestry
- unit tests for task.component_*_cost

- usability tweaks
++ autocomplete supplier selection (and creation)
++ pop-up for new employee, new PO, new labor cost
++ easy way to pair components & tasks
++ show which components not associated, quickly make new tasks
++ checkbox to show unit costs on estimate
++ click tr edits/shows
-- after adding employee, active the labor entry field and pre-select the new person
-- how to destroy markups?  (auto delete if no associated?)
-- ajax for PO#log_cost material#edit_cost
++ spinners
++ icons
++ explanative text
++ table alignment

- performance
-- sum in DB, not inject
-- alternate caching strategies (delete on change, generate on demand?)

- project as contract
- task ordering / sorting
- milestone / task percent complete UI
- parametric components
- versioning interface
- equation quantities



- reporting
-- estimates, proposals, invoices
++ work timeline w/ deadlines
++ labor reporting for michelle
++ graphs

- redesign UI to reduce vertical scrolling, white space

- user permissions
