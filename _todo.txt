- speed up tests
+ deleting markup doesn't refresh cost
+ edit laborer

- bank draws (invoice tracking)
-- JS total for balanced
-- validate uniqueness of invoice date in context of project
-- round to cent (decimal migration)
-- payment line functional tests

- use awesome_nested_set instead of ancestry
- unit tests for task.component_*_cost
- better coverage on markup tests
+ task ordering / sorting
- milestone / task percent complete UI


- usability tweaks
++ sparklines @ task, component index
-- after adding employee, active the labor entry field and pre-select the new person
-- how to destroy markups?  (auto delete if no associated?)
-- ajax for PO#log_cost material#edit_cost
-- integrate different cost types into single display
-- modal cost creation dialog; unit/fixed/contract/etc
-- project markups interface broken
-- change cost's component


- performance
++ Model.association.sum(attribute)
-- alternate caching strategies (delete on change, generate on demand?, eliminate completely?, view caching?)
-- eliminate redundant caching


- reporting
-- estimates, proposals, invoices
++ work timeline w/ deadlines
++ labor reporting for michelle
++ graphs

- project as contract
- user permissions
- equation quantities
- parametric components


Completed
+ projected costs
+ active tasks
+ inherited quantities
+ rework markups
+ auto-deactivate at 100%
+ refactor deadlines to be either relative or absolute, cache relative deadline value
+ versioning (https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail)
+ xhr functional tests
+ add actual finish date to deadlines
+ task has_many milestones
+ re-work markups to be at bottom
+ drag & drop positioning of components, tasks, contracts
+ add note field to labor cost
+ material cost summary
+ allow editing of labor cost date (material cost?)
+ projected net (estimated_cost - raw_projected_cost)
+ contracts in components

+ project dashboard
++ active tasks (with labor + material creation buttons)
++ printable timeline
++ projected cost
++ print purchase orders
++ schedule

+ bank draws (invoice tracking)
++ clean up tests
++ filtering costs by effective date
++ states for tasks w/o estimate
++ estimates should be estimated_cost, cost
++ tasks not reflected in components
++ invoicing when previous payments not distributed to components
++ refactor controller to be step-based
++ states for payments that don't balance
++ controller tests
++ track costs back to estimate
++ contract cost error on new invoice
++ only show 'next step' on payments if balanced
++ drawing retainage
++ unexpected retainage UI

+ usability tweaks
++ autocomplete supplier selection (and creation)
++ pop-up for new employee, new PO, new labor cost
++ easy way to pair components & tasks
++ show which components not associated, quickly make new tasks
++ checkbox to show unit costs on estimate
++ click tr edits/shows
++ spinners
++ icons
++ explanative text
++ table alignment
